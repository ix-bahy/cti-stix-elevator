Getting Started
===============

``stixmarx`` is a library for applying data markings to STIX documents. It is written in Python and is intended for use by developers.

The ``stixmarx`` package requires the python-stix library. The ``stixmarx`` package provides marking functionality for ``python-stix``, ``python-cybox`` and ``python-maec`` objects.

The library was made and tested with the use of the following libraries:
